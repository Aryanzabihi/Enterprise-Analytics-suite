# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Customer Service Dashboard

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Fix for "Sample dataset file not found!" Error

**The error you're seeing is because you're running the old `cs.py` file instead of the new refactored dashboard.**

### ❌ What NOT to do:
```bash
# DON'T run this - it's the old monolithic file
python cs.py
# or
streamlit run cs.py
```

### ✅ What TO do:
```bash
# DO run this - it's the new refactored dashboard
streamlit run cs_main.py
```

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Make sure you're in the `cs` directory:**
   ```bash
   cd cs
   ```

2. **Run the new dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run cs_main.py
   ```

3. **For Windows users, you can also use:**
   - Double-click `run_dashboard.bat`
   - Or run `run_dashboard.ps1` in PowerShell

## 📁 New Project Structure:

The old `cs.py` (6440 lines) has been refactored into:

- **`cs_main.py`** ← **MAIN ENTRY POINT** (run this!)
- **`cs_metrics_calculator.py`** - All analytics functions
- **`cs_data_utils.py`** - Data handling utilities  
- **`cs_styling.py`** - UI styling and components
- **`cs_pages/`** - Individual page modules

## 🎯 Why This Fixes Your Error:

- **Old `cs.py`**: Tried to load sample data from a file (causing "file not found" error)
- **New `cs_main.py`**: Generates sample data in memory (no file loading needed)

## 🧪 Test the Fix:

1. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   python test_refactored.py
   ```

2. **Check all imports work:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import cs_main; print('✅ All imports successful!')"
   ```

## 🚀 Benefits of the New Structure:

- ✅ **No more file loading errors**
- ✅ **Faster performance** (optimized code)
- ✅ **Better maintainability** (modular design)
- ✅ **Cleaner code** (separated concerns)
- ✅ **Easier debugging** (isolated modules)

## 🔍 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Verify you're in the right directory:**
   ```bash
   ls  # Should show cs_main.py, not just cs.py
   ```

3. **Run the runner script:**
   ```bash
   python run_dashboard.py
   ```

**Remember: Always run `cs_main.py`, never `cs.py`!** 🎯
